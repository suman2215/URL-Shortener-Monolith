# URL-Shortener-Monolith
This is a simple URL Shortener application built using Flask and Flask-RESTful in Python. The application allows users to shorten URLs and store them in a MongoDB database. The shortened URLs can be used to redirect to the original URLs. The application also uses Memcached for caching, improving performance by reducing the load on the database.
